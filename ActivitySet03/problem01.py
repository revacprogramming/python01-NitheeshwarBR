# Problem 1: Rectangle Area
# Develop a program that, given as input the cartesian coordinates of three vertices of a Rectangle,
# reports the area of that Rectangle. You will recall that the area of a Rectangle is the product of
# the lengths of any two adjacent sides.
# Input: The first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many Rectangles are to be
# analyzed. Each Rectangle is described on a single line via six real numbers, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3,
# and y3, separated by spaces. These provide the coordinates of three of the Rectangleâ€™s vertices,
# namely P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2), and P3(x3, y3).
# Output: For each Rectangle provided as input, report its area.
# Sample input
# ------------
# 3
# 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0
# -1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 1.0 1.0
# 5.0 9.0 -0.5 0.0 7.5 5.0
# Resultant output
# ----------------
# Area of Rectangle with vertices (0.0,0.0),(0.0,1.0),(1.0,0.0) is 1.0
# Area of Rectangle with vertices (-1.0,2.0),(3.0,5.0),(1.0,1.0) is 10.0
# Area of Rectangle with vertices (5.0,9.0),(-0.5,0.0),(7.5,5.0) is 44.5
